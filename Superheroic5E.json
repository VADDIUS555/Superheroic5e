						"{@bold Superheroic 5th Edition}, or {@bold S5E}, is a complete superhero system built on the fifth edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game. With S5E, you can create your favorite heroes from comic books, films, video games, and TV, as well as an endless number of original supers ready to take to the streets and beyond.",
						{
							"type": "section",
							"name": "What is S5E?",
							"page": 1,
							"entries": [
								"S5E is a {@bold tabletop roleplaying game}. Each of these words tells you something important. First, it is a {@bold tabletop} game, which means it is a game played by a group of people around a table (though that can be a virtual 'table' as well, over the internet). Card games like poker, and board games like chess, are also tabletop games.",
								"Second, it involves {@bold roleplaying}. This means everyone, Game Master included, plays roles. Players play as fictional superheroes created out of their imaginations! The Game",
								"Master, or GM, plays as the world and the other people in it, responding to the players' choices. Everyone roleplays, which means they get to decide who their character is, what they do, and how they react to things that happen in the game. Feel free to get into acting as much or as little as you enjoy. Some groups dress up and speak in character voices, exploring backstories and motivations like a committed theater troupe. Other groups focus on the game part of the roleplaying game, engaging more with the rules and exploring how to develop their characters mechanically.",
								"And, of course, most groups do both to some extent.",
								"Furthermore, it is a {@bold game}. Though roleplaying games are collective story-telling activities, they are also structured by rules. While a free-form improvisational storytelling experience can be rewarding and fun, S5E has rules that limit what can and cannot occur. To determine what happens in situations where there is conflict or risk, we roll a die to help randomize results. This way, everyone at the table can be surprised by what happens in our story, including the GM. It is not the GM's job to tell the players a story; on the contrary, it is everyone's job to play their roles in the game and find out what happens together. Indeed, it helps to think of the dice as another player contributing to the story, sometimes taking it in unexpected directions.",
								"S5E is a roleplaying game in another sense as well.",
								"Though it is structured by rules, you cannot really win or lose S5E, because the point of the game is for people to come together to have fun! This is and always should be the primary purpose of playing S5E, so that everyone involved enjoys themselves. This doesn't mean that the experience needs to be easy or always end in victory, mind you\u2014we enjoy stories of struggle and loss sometimes too, after all. We strongly recommend everyone playing together spend time before the first session discussing openly what kind of game you'd like to create together, and how dark or light, how grim or hopeful, you'd like your world to be. And just as importantly, players should discuss whether the presence of any particular content might ruin people's fun. It's a simple courtesy to your friends and fellow players to respect each other's wishes, so that everyone can enjoy themselves. That's the point of playing a game together, after all! Recommended safety tools in Appendix 2 can help with tables and participants deciding this together."

								"To start playing a game of S5E, you need a few things.",
								"First, S5E is a game played with friends, so you'll need at least two people, though games can have upwards to six or even ten players. The more the merrier, but recognize that as the number of players increase, so do the heroes sharing the spotlight in your collective tale.",
								"One of these players takes the role of the Game Master, or GM. Whereas the other players take on the roles of a single hero, the GM plays the world around the heroes, including the supporting cast of characters, known as nonplayer characters, or NPCs, as well as the villains whom the heroes must face. The GM also handles the environment and helps decide rules questions, though those can be discussed and decided among the group as well.",
								"You also need dice. The most important die in S5E is the icosahedron, or twenty-sided die; you use it for almost everything. Ideally, each player has one available. You also need a few four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided, and twelve-sided dice, for rolling damage and other things.",
								"Beyond that, you need character sheets for each player, pencils, and a table to gather around. These can also be digital, of course, and your play space can be a virtual tabletop. Lastly, you need this book!",
								"The GM may wish to have a GM screen, to conceal their notes and, perhaps, their rolls as well. This can increase suspense, but it isn't necessary. Indeed, some",
								"GMs prefer to roll the dice in view of their players, to share the anticipation. GMs may also want a pre-written adventure. Most GMs prefer to tailor their adventures to suit their players and their characters, so the GM likely needs notes as well.",
								"Some game groups like to use nothing but their imaginations and words to tell the story of what their heroes do and how the epic battlefield is laid out\u2014this is called using 'the theater of the mind.' Other groups prefer to use maps and miniatures to represent their heroes and the area around them. If your group prefers maps and minis, you'll need some of those as well. S5E can be played either way, however, and rules for using both methods can be found in Chapter Seven: Rules, below."

							"page": 1,
							"entries": [
								"The first chapter provides a step-by-step guide to character creation. In creating a character, players must consult Chapter One: Making a Superhero, when building a superhero that they would like to be. After that, most players must also consult Chapter Eight: Superpowers, to select which superpowers their heroes have.",
								"There are hundreds of powers, which might initially overwhelm new players at first glance. Don't fret! The powers are broken down by superheroic class and level, so there are a manageable number available for a player to choose at any given level, or when making a new hero.",
								"After character creation, there are several sections of the book you may find yourself referring to regularly, so they deserve special mention here. If you are a player, you should make note of the pages with their superheroic class described, because it grants them special features and determines how many powers you know. Second, you might record the pages in Chapter Eight, where their powers are listed.",
								"If a group wishes to get to playing as quickly as possible, some prebuilt heroes are also available with the starter adventure (available separately).",
								"If you are a GM, you should familiarize yourself with the basics of the rules, found in Chapter Seven: Rules. For more detailed guidance, please consult the Gamemaster's Guide, and foes and threats can be found in the Augmented Operator Registry (both sold separately)",

Heroes from levels 5-10 usually patrol a wider area, perhaps a large city, and face solo-supervillains and larger threats. Such heroes may be young superteams or up-and-coming heroes. Level 11-16 heroes, on the other hand, are powerful enough to fight global threats, like teams of supervillains trying to conquer whole countries, mega-corporations trying to dominate the world, or even alien invasions. And the most powerful heroes, those of levels 17-20, bear the heavy burden of protecting the galaxy, or even the universe, from cosmic threats of all kinds.",

Other players want character-driven and conflicted heroes with moral uncertainty. Still others want to play a team of angsty teen heroes, working together for the first time. Yet others want to explore the dark side, playing amoral supers or even outright villains. Everyone playing together should be on the same page about the desired tone at the start of play, though of course it can shift and change over time.",
									"When a group of friends get together to watch a movie or eat a meal, they check in with each other to find out what everyone would enjoy. Similarly, when playing a game of S5E, players should check in with each other to find out what kind of content they welcome and what they would rather avoid.",
									"Roleplaying games can involve danger and death, romance and sex, horror, and hate\u2014the whole range of human emotion and experience. Just as some folks like horror movies and some don't, some players want death or sex or spiders or prejudice in their games and others won't. The point of S5E is to allow a group of friends to play a game and tell a story together that they all find fun and rewarding. If someone isn't finding the experience fulfilling or enjoyable, something has gone wrong.",
									"Some content can be upsetting or annoying to players, so much so that it breaks them out of the imaginative experience or ruins their fun. For example, some players might want to avoid racism or sexual assault, whereas others might get so grossed out by body horror that they can't enjoy the game that session. Again, establishing what content folks do and don't want up front (and on an ongoing basis) helps to ensure that everyone has a good time--which is, after all, the point of sitting down to play a game together!",
